== Upgrade Notice ==

It is NECESSARY to rebuild the cache. It is RECOMMENDED to rebuild the Featured Images with this version. Apple has switched from LinkShare to PHG (Apply Here: http://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/apply).

== Note ==

The App Store Assistant can cache the data from your application in the Wordpress database for a preset number of hours. App icons and screenshots are cached on your server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Whoa, some of my links don't work when I have multiple shortcodes on one page/post? =
Each shortcode is designed to be used just once on a page/post. If you want to have multiple items listed on one page, than I would suggest using the [ios_app_list] shortcode. You can have a comma separated list of items to be displayed.

= I really like the plugin, can I donate to the project? =
Why, thank you for asking, of course you can. Just click the [donate link](http://theiphoneappslist.com/donate/ "Donate").
