	<p>The easiest way to insert a shortcode for an item from the App Store or Mac App Store is to use the "New App Post" button to the left. This will allow you to search for the app you want. Once found, it will create a shorcode or give you the option to create a post from the found app.</p><p>If you choose to create a post, it will insert the shortcode, add a featured image from the App's icon or iTunes Artwork, add the categories and create a new post. In the settings you can choose whether the post should be saved as a Draft, Pending of Published post.</p>

<p>If you would like to manually insert a shortcode, there are buttons in the Post Editor box.</p>
